### üí° Highlight Snippet:

```python
import json

# A dictionary representing a user's game data
player_data = {
    "username": "ProGamer1",
    "level": 12,
    "inventory": ["Magic Sword", "Health Potion", "Gold Coins"],
    "is_active": True
}

# Save the entire dictionary to a file using the json module
with open('player_save.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(player_data, file, indent=4)

print("Game data saved successfully!")
